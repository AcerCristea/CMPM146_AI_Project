# CMPM146 Creative Project
----------------------------------------------------------------
This goes over my final project for CMPM146 during junior year at UCSC
----------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Overview: 

Our group decided to create an economy that meets a society’s specified needs. Our AI will design a price structure for game items within a well-balanced engineered economy. The AI will dynamically adjust item prices based on a supply and demand curve that we define. The AI will also dynamically adjust land to grow and produce these items, ensuring the world grows the correct amount of products to meet the population’s needs.

The program operates by reading in a Json file. We then combine this information with a genetic algorithms until we find out best sample. After 20 generations, the best scoring genome information is printed out with its land allocation, score, its surplus of items made and its consumption of items (how many people bought).
